# White Paper : ClearResusCascading Protocol

The ClearResusCascading Protocol is a sophisticated, five-stage blood purification system designed to address vaccine-induced complications, specifically targeting spike proteins, Fibrin Amyloid Microclots (FARM), and plasmid DNA sequences (e.g., from Moderna, Pfizer vaccines) with extreme precision. 

The protocol uses zwitterionic CNC-coated MNPs (20 nm, 30–40 m²/g, pore size 3–9 nm, +20 to +40 mV), ACE2 ligands (Kd ~0.1–5 nM) and ultrasound (1 MHz histotripsy, 5–50 kHz resonators) to purify blood. 

By integrating Zwitterionic Crystalline Nanocellulose (CNC) as a biocompatible, sustainable, and biomimetic material.The system leverages synergy across stages through AI-driven optimization (CNN-Transformer, Reinforcement Learning) and biomimicry redundancy via diatom-inspired pore structures and φ-scaled (1.618033988749895) designs, mimicking natural filtration systems. Each stage is detailed, with CNC’s role explicitly highlighted.

	•	Schauberger: Vortex flow, resonators, and cleaning mimic natural water purification.
	•	Perez: φ = 1.618033988749895 scales pores, ligands, and channels for biomimetic efficiency.
